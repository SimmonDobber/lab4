# lab4
Project made for labolatory classes.
The goal of the task was to make simple console app which uses H2 database and Hibernate for ORM. 
The application was expected to propertly execute a few predefined queries and return some feedback on the console.
In my solution I created an entire Spring project making the app extensible with new queries. 
Instead of hardcoded queries and console output I made app adapted for potential frontend by making the controllers and implementing a few sample endpoints.
